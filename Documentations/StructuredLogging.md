# The Importance of Structured/Semantic Logging

## Overview

Structured or semantic logging is a modern approach to logging that focuses on the format and context of log messages, making them more meaningful, searchable, and analyzable. It contrasts with traditional plain-text logging by treating log data more like structured, queryable data.

## Why Structured Logging?

### Enhanced Searchability and Analysis
- Structured logs allow for easier filtering and querying, enabling quick pinpointing of specific issues.

### Improved Context in Logs
- By including key-value pairs in logs, structured logging provides richer context, making it easier to understand the sequence of events and the state of the application.

### Better Monitoring and Alerting
- Structured data can be efficiently parsed and ingested by monitoring tools, aiding in real-time alerting and issue resolution.

## Implementation in Serilog

For this project, we've implemented structured logging using Serilog, a powerful and versatile logging framework.

### Key Features
- **Correlation ID**: Set up by a correlation middleware (see `Common.Web` for more details), the correlation ID links log entries from the same request, enhancing traceability.
- **Connection Remote Port**: Utilizes Serilog's `BeginScope` for logging the `ConnectionRemotePort`, demonstrating the capability to log specific request details.
- **Event ID Factory**: Custom event IDs defined in `VivaGeoApiEvent` enum provide clarity and specificity to log entries, making it easier to identify and analyze specific actions or events in the application.

### Output Templates
- **Console**:`{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [{Level}] (EventId: {EventId}) {Message}{NewLine}{Exception}`

- **Debug**:`{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [{Level}] (EventId: {EventId}) (CorrelationId: {CorrelationId}) (ReqId: {RequestId}) (ConnId: {ConnectionId}) (ConnRemotePort: {ConnectionRemotePort}) {Message}{NewLine}{Exception}`

## Conclusion

Structured logging, especially with a tool like Serilog, is essential for modern applications, providing a robust mechanism for logging that is not only informative but also conducive to analysis, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
