## Overview

This document outlines the structure of the database as inferred from the provided diagram. The database consists of several tables with relationships between them.

## Tables and Relationships
![DatabaseDiagram.PNG](Images%2FDatabase%2FDatabaseDiagram.PNG)
### `EFMigrationsHistory`
- **Purpose**: Tracks migration history for Entity Framework.
- **Columns**:
  - `ProductVersion`: The version of the product (nvarchar(32)).
  - `MigrationId`: The ID of the migration (nvarchar(150)).

### `Countries`
- **Purpose**: Stores information about countries.
- **Columns**:
  - `CommonName`: The common name of the country (nvarchar(100)).
  - `Capital`: The capital city of the country (nvarchar(100)).
  - `CountryId`: The primary key for the country (int).

### `Borders`
- **Purpose**: Contains information about country borders.
- **Columns**:
  - `BorderCode`: A code representing the border (nvarchar(50)).
  - `BorderId`: The primary key for the border (int).

### `CountryBorder`
- **Purpose**: A junction table that represents the many-to-many relationship between countries and their borders.
- **Columns**:
  - `CountryId`: A foreign key relating to `Countries` (int).
  - `BorderId`: A foreign key relating to `Borders` (int).

## Relationships

- Each `Country` can have multiple `Borders` through the `CountryBorder` table.
- Each `Border` can be associated with multiple `Countries` through the `CountryBorder` table.

The relationships are represented by lines connecting the tables, indicating how the data is interrelated.

## Conclusion

The database is designed to effectively manage and query data related to countries and their geographical borders. The use of a junction table allows for a flexible many-to-many relationship between countries and borders.

## Note on Many-to-Many Relationship Handling

In designing the many-to-many relationship between `Countries` and `Borders`, there were two architectural choices:

1. Utilize Entity Framework's navigation properties to implicitly handle the relationship.
2. Explicitly create a `CountryBorder` entity and configure it through ModelBuilder.

The chosen approach was the second option. While it adds a bit more complexity, it offers better scalability for the application. Explicitly creating the `CountryBorder` entity allows for future enhancements, such as adding additional columns to the table that can store metadata like `creationTime`, `LastUpdateTime`, and in the context of a distributed system, `TenantId` or `CorrelationId`.

This approach affords greater flexibility in managing the relationship and provides the opportunity to capture more detailed information about the association between countries and borders, which can be invaluable for auditing, reporting, and data analysis in a real-world application.
